# Crime Hotspot Detection: A Predictive Analytics Project

![Crime Hotspot Detection](crime_hotspot_detection.jpg)

## Introduction

Welcome to the Crime Hotspot Detection project! This repository contains a predictive analytics project focused on crime hotspot detection using the Chicago crime dataset. The goal of this project is to analyze crime trends over multiple years, merge and clean the datasets, and develop predictive models to forecast the crime rate at specific areas in the future.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the "Chicago Crime Dataset" obtained from the official Chicago city's open data portal. The dataset covers incidents of crimes that occurred from multiple years, starting from 2002 to the most recent data available. It includes essential information such as date, type of crime, location, and other relevant attributes.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

1. Data Collection and Preprocessing: Collect crime data from the Chicago crime dataset for multiple years, merge the datasets, and clean the data to ensure it is suitable for predictive analytics.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct exploratory analysis to identify crime trends over the years and determine the areas with the highest crime incidents.

3. Crime Hotspot Detection: Utilize supervised machine learning techniques such as Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and ensemble methods to predict crime rates based on various factors, including time, location, and other parameters.

4. Predictive Modeling: Develop predictive models to forecast crime rates at specific areas in the future. The models will help identify potential crime hotspots and assist law enforcement in taking appropriate measures to enhance public safety.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the Chicago crime datasets collected from multiple years.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks used for data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and predictive modeling.
- `src/`: Source code for predictive modeling algorithms and utility functions.
- `results/`: Stores the results, including visualizations and prediction outputs.
- `README.md`: The file you are currently reading, providing an overview of the project.

## Getting Started

To reproduce the results of this project or contribute to it, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/crime-hotspot-detection.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies using either `pip` or `conda`. The dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

3. Explore the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to understand the data preprocessing, EDA, and predictive modeling process.

4. Run the predictive modeling scripts in the `src/` directory to generate crime rate predictions for specific areas.
